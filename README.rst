WHAT???
-------
Java + libGDX version of FlappyBalt by Adam Atomics. The original game was written in AS3 + Flixel (`Source <https://github.com/AdamAtomic/Flappybalt>`_, `Game <http://adamatomic.com/flappybalt/>`_).


WHY??
----
Because

1. the voices in my head told me to do it
2. needed some code for comparing flixel to barebone libgdx (i.e. not even scene2d or the tween libs)

On a more serious note, if you are thinking about porting your flixel project to mobile platforms, you might want to look at `flixel-gdx <https://github.com/flixel-gdx/flixel-gdx>`_ instead (haven't tried it myself).

The secret recipe for awesomeness is

1. ant setup
2. ant run
3. flap!
